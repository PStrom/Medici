# Medici
We are a community of practitioners exploring the living craft of applied IT-architecture.

Grounded in technology architecture, we gather to share actionable patterns, guides, and operating models — not as fixed truths, but as evolving tools for sensemaking and change.

Our core belief is that architecture is an infinite game: not something to be finished, but a way of continuously shaping how our enterprises operate, change, and adapt. To play this game well, we draw not only on architectural best practices, but on ideas from beyond the traditional domain — from lean thinking and service design, to storytelling, psychology, systems theory and much more.

Inspired by the Medici Effect, we believe breakthroughs happen at the intersections. That’s why we explore boundaries: between disciplines, between structure and between people. Between what is and what could be.

We’re here to learn, practice, and co-create architectures that matter — in Gothenburg and beyond.


# Philosophy Statement

We believe architecture is not a static discipline, but a living, generative practice — an infinite game.
Our community exists to explore how actionable architecture emerges when we collide it with ideas from other domains: psychology, design, systems thinking, lean, storytelling, and more.

We also sense the importance of knowledge about the material we work with. The material is the digital material. The knowledge mainly comes from software engineering and practices about how to bridge the gap to the business and towards user mental models, basically object orientation in different forms.

Inspired by the Medici Effect, we embrace the power of the intersection — where the unexpected creates the practical, and where ideas leap across boundaries to shape better architectures.

We are also inspired in form by other movements, such as Modernism and architecture, design and art with formations such as 'Göteborgskoloristerna' and 'Kunstguppe Brucke' who acted as working individualslearning and exploring together.
